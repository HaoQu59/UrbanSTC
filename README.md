# UrbanSTC

In this study, we use contrastive self-supervision learning for the fine-grained urban flow inference.

*This is an easy implement of UrbanSTC using Pytorch 1.6, tested on Ubuntu 16.04 with a RTX 2080 GPU.*

# Dataset

Here, we release P1 in TaxiBJ (7/1/2013-10/31/2013) for public use. Totally, there 1530, 765 and 765 samples in the training, validation and test set respectively. Besides, the corresponding external factors data (e.g., meteorology, time features) are also included.
