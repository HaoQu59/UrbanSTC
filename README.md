# UrbanSTC

In this study, we use contrastive self-supervision learning for the fine-grained urban flow inference.

*This is an easy implement of UrbanSTC using Pytorch 1.6, tested on Ubuntu 16.04 with a RTX 2080 GPU.*

# Result

We evaluate our method on TaxiBJ in four time periods with different proportions of training data. The main experimental results are shown as follows:

# Dataset

Here, we release P1 in TaxiBJ (7/1/2013-10/31/2013) for public use. Totally, there 1530, 765 and 765 samples in the training, validation and test set respectively. Besides, the corresponding external factors data (e.g., meteorology, time features) are also included.
